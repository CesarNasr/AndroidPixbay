This is a sample app that includes screens to : - Register; -Login; -Home Screen; Details Screeen;

Technologies and Languages used :
- Kotlin
- Android SDK

Layouts and Designs:
- Constraint and other Layouts
- Material Design
PS: Haven't focused on UI/UX practices

Jetpack Library
- Navigation Component Architecture
- Safe Args
- ViewModels
- LiveData
- Data binding

Architecures and patterns :
- MVVM
- Repository pattern
- Dependency Injection using Dagger-Hilt, integrated with viewmodels and views(fragments and activities)
- A  single layer of abstraction between Data layer and Presention Layer using interfaces (Reposiotry & RepositoryImpl)
- Tried to implement SOLID principles

What could have been added :
- Properly/Fully implementing Clean Architecture
- Better UX practices
- Better SOLID Principles
- Implementing Compose UI instead of XML layouts
- Using Binding Adapters instead of writing some code inside fragments/viewmodels

Thank you :)
